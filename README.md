# Deadline Todo List App

## Intro

This is a simple todo list app that allows you to add, edit, and delete tasks.
The app is built using the React framework and uses a MongoDB database to store the tasks.

## Running the client app

To run the client app, run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Running the server app

To run the server app, first you'll need to clone these two repos:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danielbellmas/todos-service.git
git clone https://github.com/danielbellmas/notification-service.git
```

Then, follow the instructions in the README.md file for each repo to run the server app.
